PeerBid
The P2P Auction System is a decentralized auction platform that allows participants to initiate auctions, place bids, and conclude transactions using Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) as the primary form of communication.

Challenge Overview
The challenge involves developing a simple P2P auction system with the following key features:

Auction Initialization: Clients should be able to initiate auctions by specifying the item for sale and the starting price.
Bid Handling: Participants can place bids on ongoing auctions, with bids being broadcasted to all network participants.
Auction Conclusion: Upon auction closure, the system must handle distributed transactions and notify all participants of the auction outcome.
Technical Requirements
P2P Architecture: Adherence to a decentralized P2P architecture, avoiding traditional client/server models.
RPC Communication: Utilization of JSON RPC 2.0 or gRPC for node communication.
Command-Line Interface (CLI): Implementation of a command-line interface for interaction; a graphical UI is not required.
Database: Usage of SQLite for any database requirements.
Compatibility: Ensure compatibility across multiple operating systems: Linux, OSX, Windows.
Installation and Setup
To run the P2P Auction System on your machine, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/p2p-auction-system.git
cd p2p-auction-system
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Start the system:

bash
Copy code
npm start
Usage
Once the system is up and running, you can perform the following actions:

Initiate Auction: Use the CLI to initiate auctions by specifying the item and starting price.
Place Bid: Participate in ongoing auctions by placing bids.
Monitor Auction: Keep track of ongoing auctions and their status.
Handle Auction Conclusion: Upon auction closure, handle distributed transactions and receive notifications of the auction outcome.
Limitations and Future Improvements
While the current implementation meets the basic requirements, there are areas for improvement:

Graphical User Interface (GUI): Consider adding a graphical UI for improved user experience.
Enhanced Security: Implement encryption and authentication mechanisms to enhance security.
Scalability: Optimize the system for scalability to handle a larger number of participants and auctions.
Error Handling: Enhance error handling to provide better feedback to users in case of failures.
